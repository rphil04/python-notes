# Hockey Lineup Ice Time Calculator
# =================================
#
# This script calculates the expected time on ice per player based on the number of
# skaters available. The script only provides one strategy:
#
# Strategy: Set Positions
#     Divides skaters into forwards and defense, then calculates the time
#     on ice for each position.
#
# Functions:
# ----------
# calculate_time(skaters)
#     Calculates and prints the time on ice for forwards and defense.
#
# Usage:
# ------
# Run the script and provide the number of skaters when prompted.

    game_duration = 60  # Game duration in minutes
    total_game_time = game_duration * 60  # Convert game duration to seconds
